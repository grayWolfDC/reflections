When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work localy?
    to work from multiple locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
    because not all commits might be ready for public consumption, which is part of the reason for GitHub.

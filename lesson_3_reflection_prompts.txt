When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work localy?
    to work from multiple locations

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date 
with your remote repository?
    because not all commits might be ready for public consumption, which is part of the reason for GitHub.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    fork is a copy of a repository existing on GitHub in GitHub. I would use this when I want to work with a repository
    for which I do not have the permission to change.

    clone is a copy of a GitHub repository on a computer, useful when wanting to use or work with items in the repository.
    it can also be a copy of local repository, though I don't know what that would be for or how to use it.
    
    branch is new trajectory in the commit history, useful when wanting to try out stuff without breaking what is already
    working.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
	This allows syncing with the remote without an internet connection. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	Would be hard to synchronize changes, hard to try stuff independently from collaborators, hard 
	to work from multiple computers; in fact nothing would be easier, unless I can afford to work with 
	a single copy on a single computer.
